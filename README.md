# Kamau Dennis data science projects

This is a repository of code and data for my data analysis and machine learning projects.

If you don't have the necessary software installed to run IPython Notebook, don't fret. You can use nbviewer to view a notebook on the web.

For example, if you want to view the notebook in the Facial Recognition directory, copy the full link to the notebook then paste it into nbviewer.
